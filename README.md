## The WorkCenter

### The Diving Days
The name is Christian. I am a professional commercial diver and NDT technician. Became part of the diving industry back in 2013 on and off. Some of the work involved was husbandry, video documentation, and dredging operations.

Was even able to work in Encinada, Mexico for some time.

When time allows, technical diving is something that is enjoyed within the normoxic levels of mixed gas diving.
